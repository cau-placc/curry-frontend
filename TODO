Completed
=========
- Anonymous free variables implemented
- hierarchically structured modules

Still to do
===========
- !!! Check correctness of created FlatCurry files by comparison with the old frontend !!!
- Records: There is no way to explicitly import a record with its fields:
    import CompilerOpts                -- okay, works
    import CompilerOpts (Options)      -- okay, but no field labels imported
    import CompilerOpts (Options (..)) -- fails: Options is not a data type
- Module pragmas
- type classes
- option to disable nondeterminism by overlapping
- option / check for case mode
